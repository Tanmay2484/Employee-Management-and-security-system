This project is an Employee Management System that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, along with security features such as login, logout, and signup operations.

CRUD Operations:

Create: Users can input employee details, creating new employee records in the system.
Read: Users can list all employees, search for employees by ID, name, or position, and view employee details.
Update: Users can modify employee information, including name, gender, position, and salary.
Delete: Users can remove employee records from the system.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

The project employs OOP principles with the Employee class, which encapsulates employee attributes (id, name, gender, position, salary) and behavior (input, output, validation).
The class uses getter and setter methods to encapsulate data and ensure data integrity.
Static methods of the class allow for operations that apply to all employees, such as sorting and searching.
Security Features:

Login: Users must provide their employee ID and password to access the system. Passwords are validated to meet specific criteria (length, capital letter, special characters).
Logout: Users can log out of the system to protect their session from unauthorized access.
Signup: Users can create a new employee profile, including a password during signup. Password creation follows strict rules to enhance security.
In summary, this project demonstrates how to implement CRUD operations within an object-oriented framework, emphasizing security through user authentication (login and signup) and session management (logout). It provides a practical example of using C++ to build a simple but functional employee management system with these features.
